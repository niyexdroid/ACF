            The creation of the Abosedeaina Charity Foundation was as a result of a tragic incident that befell my family 18 years ago. The inspiration for the foundation's name was to commemorate my late sister (Aina Abosede). She was the quietest, most well-mannered and cheerful among my siblings. She was happily married but unfortunately developed eclampsia during her pregnancy period. It became even more complicated during labour; She lost her sight and became unconscious. She had an emergency Caesarean Section but unfortunately, we lost both her and the baby.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was heartbreaking news for the family especially my mother, because some few years back, she also lost her first daughter, my elder sister who died a few days after giving birth to her fourth child. Ever since then, I have always had it in mind to start a foundation in their memory.
